## Container Management Platforms - Implementations


- **[Rancher (License: Apache 2.0)](http://rancher.com/rancher/)**  
[Rancher - github](https://github.com/rancher/rancher)  
Rancher is an open source software platform that enables organizations to run containers in production. With Rancher, organizations no longer have to build a container services platform from scratch using a distinct set of open source technologies. Rancher supplies the entire software stack needed to manage containers in production. Rancher natively supports and manages all of your Kubernetes, Mesos, and Swarm clusters.


- **[Shipyard - Composable Docker Management (License: Apache 2.0)](https://shipyard-project.com/)**  
[Shipyard - github](https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard)  
Built on Docker Swarm, Shipyard gives you the ability to manage Docker resources including containers, images, private registries and more.
Shipyard differs from other management applications in that it promotes composability and is 100% compatible with the Docker Remote API. Shipyard manages containers, images, nodes, private registries cluster-wide as well as providing authentication and role based access control.


- **[Panamax - Docker Management for Humans (License: Apache 2.0)](http://panamax.io/)**  
[Panamax - Wiki](https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/panamax-ui/wiki)  
Panamax is a containerized app creator with an open-source app marketplace hosted in GitHub. Panamax provides a friendly interface for users of Docker, Fleet & CoreOS. With Panamax, you can easily create, share and deploy any containerized app no matter how complex it might be.
Poznamka: Panamax is not even near 1.0 yet. It does function, but when it doesn’t we’d hope you report the bug or get involved actively developing it. 


- **[Portrainer - The easiest way to manage docker (License: ZLIB)](http://portainer.io/)**  
[Portrainer - github](https://github.com/portainer/portainer)  
[Portrainer and the other solutions](http://portainer.io/portainer-comparison.html)  
Portainer is a lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your Docker host or Swarm cluster.
Portainer is meant to be as simple to deploy as it is to use. It consists of a single container that can run on any Docker engine (Docker for Linux and Docker for Windows are supported).
Portainer allows you to manage your Docker containers, images, volumes, networks and more ! It is compatible with the standalone Docker engine and with Docker Swarm.


- **[vamp - Very Awesome Microservices Platform (License: Apache 2.0)](http://vamp.io/)**  
[Vamp - github](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp)  
[Vamp compared to software based proxies and load balancers](http://vamp.io/why-use-vamp/vamp-compared-to/proxies-and-load-balancers/)
[Vamp compared to container schedulers and container clouds (CPaaS)](http://vamp.io/why-use-vamp/vamp-compared-to/paas-and-container-systems/)
[Vamp compared to frameworks and tools](http://vamp.io/why-use-vamp/vamp-compared-to/frameworks-and-tools/)
Vamp's core features are a platform-agnostic microservices DSL, easy A-B testing/canary releasing on everything and a deep and extendable metrics engine that monitors everything and directly feeds back into your services. Vamp is open source and mostly written in Scala, with some parts in Go.


- **[Kontena (License: Apache-2.0)](https://www.kontena.io/)**  
[Kontena - github](https://github.com/kontena/kontena)  
Kontena is a new developer friendly, open source platform for orchestrating applications that are run on Docker containers. It simplifies deploying and running containerized applications on any infrastructure. By leveraging technologies such as Docker, CoreOS and Weave, it provides complete solution for organizations of any size. Kontena is built to maximize developer happiness; it is designed for application developers and therefore does not require ops teams to setup or maintain. Therefore, it is an ideal choice for organizations without aspiration to configure and maintain scalable Docker container infrastructure. At the moment, Docker is supported but expect to see support for technologies like Windows Containers, CoreOS rkt and more!  
**Features:**  
\- Multi-host, multi AZ container orchestration  
\- Overlay network technology by Weaveworks  
\- Zero-downtime dynamic load balancing  
\- Abstraction to describe services running in containers  
\- Private Docker image repository  
\- Kontena Vault - a secure storage for managing secrets  
\- VPN access to backend containers  
\- Heroku-like application deployment workflow  


- **[Porto - Yet another Linux container management system (License: LGPL)](https://github.com/yandex/porto)**  -> **Yandex**  
Porto is a Linux container management system, developed by Yandex. The main goal of Porto is to create a convenient, reliable interface over several Linux kernel mechanism such as cgroups, namespaces, mounts, networking etc. Porto is intended to be used as a base for building large infrastructure projects. Porto provides a protobuf-based interface via an Unix socket. C++, Python and Go APIs are included. A command line tool (portoctl) for managing Porto-containers is also provided.


- **[Kinematic (License: Apache 2.0)](https://kitematic.com/)**  
[Kinematic - github](https://github.com/docker/kitematic)  
Kitematic is a simple application for managing Docker containers on Mac, Linux and Windows.


- **[Admiral (License: Apache 2.0)](https://github.com/vmware/admiral)**  -> **Vmware**  
Admiral is a highly scalable and very lightweight Container Management platform for deploying and managing container based applications. It is designed to have a small footprint and boot extremely quickly. Admiral™ is intended to provide automated deployment and lifecycle management of containers. This container management solution can help reduce complexity and achieve advantages including simplified and automated application delivery, optimized resource utilization along with business governance and applying business policies and overall data center integration.


- **[HPE Stackato](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/cloud/stackato.html)**  
HPE Helion Stackato is a flexible and scalable managed cloud-native platform based on Cloud Foundry technology and Docker containers.
