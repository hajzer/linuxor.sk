RancherOS is a minimalist Linux distribution perfect for running Docker containers. By running Docker directly on top of the kernel and delivering Linux services as containers, RancherOS delivers just what you need to build what you want. RancherOS is the smallest, easiest way to run containers at scale in production, and includes only the services needed to run Docker. By removing unneeded libraries, and running the latest version of Docker by default, RancherOS reduces the hassle with updating, patching, and maintaining your container host operating system. Containers on RancherOS boot in seconds, making it easy for teams to move and scale quickly.

CoreOS Container Linux is the leading container operating system, designed to be managed and run at massive scale, with minimal operational overhead. Applications with Container Linux run in containers, providing developer-friendly tools for deploying software. Container Linux runs on nearly any platform whether physical, virtual, or private/public cloud.

[Alpine Linux - Wiki](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org)  
Alpine Linux is an independent, non-commercial, general purpose Linux distribution designed for power users who appreciate security, simplicity and resource efficiency. Alpine Linux is built around musl libc and busybox. This makes it smaller and more resource efficient than traditional GNU/Linux distributions. A container requires no more than 8 MB and a minimal installation to disk requires around 130 MB of storage. Not only do you get a fully-fledged Linux environment but a large selection of packages from the repository. Binary packages are thinned out and split, giving you even more control over what you install, which in turn keeps your environment as small and efficient as possible. Alpine Linux was designed with security in mind. The kernel is patched with an unofficial port of grsecurity/PaX, and all userland binaries are compiled as Position Independent Executables (PIE) with stack smashing protection. These proactive security features prevent exploitation of entire classes of zero-day and other vulnerabilities.

[Intel Clear Linux - Documentation](https://clearlinux.org/documentation/)  
Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture is focused on the Cloud. Our aim was not to make yet another general-purpose Linux distribution; sometimes lean-and-fast is better than big-and-universal. While we do our best to describe marquee technologies on this website, there are many smaller optimizations and configurations to explore. We invite anyone with an interest in the Cloud to take a look and give it a spin.

[Ubuntu Core - Documentation](https://docs.ubuntu.com/core/en/)  
Ubuntu Core, a minimalist rendition of Ubuntu, is a lightweight, transactionally updated operating system designed for deployments on embedded and IoT devices, cloud and more. It runs a new breed of super-secure, remotely upgradeable Linux app packages known as snaps. The strict separation between kernel and device drivers, OS and applications means embedded engineers and application developers can easily work in parallel.

[VMware Photon OS - Wiki](https://github.com/vmware/photon/wiki)  
Photon OS is a minimal Linux container host designed to have a small footprint and tuned for VMware platforms. Photon is intended to invite collaboration around running containerized applications in a virtualized environment.  
\- **Optimized for vSphere** - Validated on and tuned for VMware product and provider platforms.  
\- **Container support** - Supports Docker, rkt, and the Pivotal Garden container specifications.    
\- **Efficient lifecycle management** - Contains a new, open-source, yum-compatible package manager that will help make the system as small as possible, but preserve the robust yum package management capabilities.
