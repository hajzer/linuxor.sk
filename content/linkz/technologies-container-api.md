[LXD API - Documentation](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/rest-api.md)

- **[Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api/)**

- **[CNI - the Container Network Interface](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni)**    
The CNI (Container Network Interface) project consists of a specification and libraries for writing plugins to configure network interfaces in Linux containers, along with a number of supported plugins. CNI concerns itself only with network connectivity of containers and removing allocated resources when the container is deleted. Because of this focus, CNI has a wide range of support and the specification is simple to implement.

- **[libnetwork - networking for docker containers (License: Apache 2.0)](https://github.com/docker/libnetwork)**  
Libnetwork provides a native Go implementation for connecting containers
The goal of libnetwork is to deliver a robust Container Network Model that provides a consistent programming interface and the required network abstractions for applications.
