## Tools for Simulation of services in the Automation and Development

- [MockSSH](https://github.com/ncouture/MockSSH)
<br>
Mock an SSH server and define all commands it supports (Python, Twisted)


- [SSHim](https://pythonhosted.org/sshim/)
<br>
SSHim is a library for testing and debugging SSH automation clients. The aim is to provide a scriptable SSH server which can be made to behave like any SSH-enabled device.


- [HoverFly - Dependencies without the sting](http://hoverfly.io/)
<br>
Hoverfly is a lightweight, open source service virtualization tool. Using Hoverfly, you can virtualize your application dependencies to create a self-contained development or test environment.
Hoverfly is a proxy written in Go. It can capture HTTP(s) traffic between an application under test and external services, and then replace the external services. It can also generate synthetic responses on the fly.
