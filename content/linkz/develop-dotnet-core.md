Topher instructed courses on malware analysis and memory forensics at SOU while also managing their cybersecurity research lab. Mainly focusing on .NET memory hijacking, he has produced tools that allow for new post exploitation attack sequences and discussed them at DEF CON 23, BSidesPDX, and SecTor 2015.



## .NET - SECURITY TOOLS

- [dnSpy - .NET assembly editor, decompiler, and debugger (*****)](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy)  
dnSpy is a tool to reverse engineer .NET assemblies. It includes a decompiler, a debugger and an assembly editor (and more) and can be easily extended by writing your own extension. It uses dnlib to read and write assemblies so it can handle obfuscated assemblies (eg. malware) without crashing.


- [de4dot - .NET deobfuscator and unpacker (****)](https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot)  
de4dot is an open source (GPLv3) .NET deobfuscator and unpacker written in C#. It will try its best to restore a packed and obfuscated assembly to almost the original assembly. Most of the obfuscation can be completely restored (eg. string encryption), but symbol renaming is impossible to restore since the original names aren't (usually) part of the obfuscated assembly.


- [GrayStorm](https://github.com/GrayKernel/GrayStorm)  
GrayStorm is an in memory attack platform that targets the .NET Framework and is injectable by utilizing GrayFrost.  
\- Attack the .NET JIT  
\- Attack .NET at the ASM level  
\- Use ASM and Metasploit payloads  
\- Utilize objects on the Managed Heap  
\- Read/Write a Method's ASM  
\- Use on-the-fly compiled C# to overwrite call addresses and JIT Stubs  
\- Disassemble a Method's ASM with BeaEngine.


- [ILSpy](http://ilspy.net/)  
ILSpy is the open-source .NET assembly browser and decompiler.


- [Reflexil](http://reflexil.net/)  
[Reflexil - github](https://github.com/sailro/Reflexil)  
Reflexil is an assembly editor and runs as a plug-in for Red Gate's Reflector, ILSpy and Telerik's JustDecompile. Reflexil is using Mono.Cecil, written by Jb Evain and is able to manipulate IL code and save the modified assemblies to disk. Reflexil also supports C#/VB.NET code injection.

Free. For everyone. Forever. 
With an open source decompilation engine


- [Jetbrains dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/)  
Free .NET Decompiler and Assembly Browser


- [ConfuseEx](http://yck1509.github.io/ConfuserEx/)  
[ConfuseEx - github](https://github.com/yck1509/ConfuserEx)  
ConfuserEx is an free, open-source protector for .NET applications. It is the successor of Confuser project.
