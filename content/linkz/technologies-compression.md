[github - zstd](http://facebook.github.io/zstd/)
<br>
Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder (see benchmarks below). It also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from any sample set. Zstandard library is provided as open source software using a BSD license.


- [FastLZ](http://fastlz.org/)
<br>
free, open-source, portable real-time compression library


- [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)
<br>
7-Zip is a file archiver with a high compression ratio.


- [gzip](http://www.gzip.org/)
<br>
gzip (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be a replacement for compress. Its main advantages over compress are much better compression and freedom from patented algorithms.


- [LZ4](http://www.lz4.org)
<br>
[github - lz4](http://cyan4973.github.io/lz4/)
<br>
LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400 MB/s per core (0.16 Bytes/cycle). It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core (0.71 Bytes/cycle). A high compression derivative, called LZ4_HC, is available, trading customizable CPU time for compression ratio. LZ4 library is provided as open source software using a BSD license.
