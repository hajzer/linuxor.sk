INTEL SGX - INTRO

2016 - Intel SGX Explained - Cryptology ePrint Archive - IACR (*****)
Victor Costan and Srinivas Devadas of MIT criticize the way SGX obtains cryptographic keys over the internet.
Intel’s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a set of extensions to the Intel architecture that aims to provide
integrity and confidentiality guarantees to securitysensitive computation performed on a computer where
all the privileged software (kernel, hypervisor, etc) is potentially malicious.

2016 - Intel® Software Guard Extensions Tutorial Series (***)
Today we are launching a multi-part tutorial series aimed at software developers who want to learn how to integrate Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) into their applications. The intent of the series is to cover every aspect of the software development cycle when building an Intel SGX application, beginning at application design and running through development, testing, packaging, and deployment. While isolated code samples and individual articles are valuable, this in-depth look at enabling Intel SGX in a single application provides developers with a hands-on and holistic view of the technology as it is woven into a real-world application.
