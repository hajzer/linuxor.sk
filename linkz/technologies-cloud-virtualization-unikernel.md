UniK (pronounced you-neek) is a tool for compiling application sources into unikernels (lightweight bootable disk images) rather than binaries.
UniK runs and manages instances of compiled images across a variety of cloud providers as well as locally on Virtualbox.
UniK utilizes a simple docker-like command line interface, making building unikernels as easy as building containers.
Supported providers:
 - Virtualbox
 - AWS
 - vSphere
 - QEMU
 - UKVM
 - Xen
 - OpenStack
 - Photon Controller
